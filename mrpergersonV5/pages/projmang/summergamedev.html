            The summer game development workshop is an interdisciplinary group
            based project that focuses on game development. Teams are formed
            from the arts and animation, computer science and other disciplines
            interested in game development. These teams create a prototype over
            the 8-9 weeks of the workshop within the community of participants.
            We organizers focus on production, pipeline, design, prototyping,
            presentation, marketing and player feedback to create the most
            viable, fun prototype in the limited time. Participants are
            encouraged to experiment with genre, style, mechanics and any other
            aspect of game development within the team setting.

              Taught a workshop, with two other SJSU professors, focused on game
              production and playtesting.

              Devised a team forming method that supported different types of
              people.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Developed a game design document template and example for
              learning.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Meet with game designers and programmers groups to discuss issues.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Brought in over 60 artists and programmers and formed over 10
              interdisciplinary teams.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">My Role</h2>
        <p>
          As a workshop lead, I worked with two other San Jose State University
          professors to plan and lead workshop meetings and assist members. I
          wrote multiple slide outlines, a game design document outline, and a
          Trello template. I assisted members by reviewing their design
          documents, trellos, and game progress. I designed the website and
          advertisements to get people to sign up.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Results</h2>
        <p>
          Our workshop attracted over 60 artists and programmers. 10
          interdisciplinary teams and 2 independent developers were formed
          shortly after.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Planning for team forming needs to happen far in advance and all
              data that needs to be taken in needs to happen early, all at once.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Learning how to manage tasks, get time estimates, and managing
              sprints is just as important as ensuring that members feel that
              they are contributing to the team.
