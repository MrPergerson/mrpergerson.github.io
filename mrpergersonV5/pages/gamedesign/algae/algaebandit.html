            Algae Bandit is a game about being a rogue crab who has chosen to
            steal food from other crabs. As the player, you get to choose how
            you want to steal food from crabs, by either using stealth or
            beating up any crab in the way. This game was developed during the
            summer of 2020 and was part of the Game Dev Best Practices Workshop,
            which was hosted by the Game Dev Club at SJSU.

        <h2 class="textbox--title">Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Moving<br />
          The player can use WASD to navigate the level. The movement mimics the
          locomotion of crabs so sideways movement is faster and moving forwards
          or backwards is slower.
          <br /><br />
          Attacking<br />
          The player can attack using either the left or right arm of the crab.
          J is tied to the left arm and K is for the right arm.
          <br /><br />
          Blocking<br />
          If J and K are pressed, then the player can block any incoming attacks
          coming from the front of the crab. Blocking doesn't protect the player
          from the side or behind the crab. Blocking depletes stamina, which
          regains slowly when not blocking. If there is no stamina, then the
          player can not block.
          <br /><br />
          Collecting<br />
          Throughout the level, there are algae that can be collected. To
          collect algae, the player just needs to collide with the algae, which
          will reduce the remaining algae in the level count.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          The core gameplay loop of the game is collecting algae that is guarded
          by other crabs. The goal of the game is to collect all the algae in
          the level. The player can navigate to each algae but they must be
          tactical when thinking about how they will approach another crab. When
          the player approaches a crab, they must be careful to not expose their
          back because it’s defenseless. The player can block attacks in front
          of them but they have limited block stamina.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Level Design</h2>
        <p>
          I designed all the levels in the game. My design process started with
          creating some interesting pathways. I would create different layouts
          in Unity until I found one that could possibly create some unique
          challenges for the player. Once the layout was finished, I would try
          to predict the player’s pathway and create challenges along the way.
          If I felt that the pathways to each piece of algae was too easy, I
          would set more challenges for the player. Once done, I would test the
          level and repeat the process until I was happy with it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Set gameplay goal (What do I want to challenge the player with?).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Create interesting base layout.</p></li>
          <li><p>Draw the pathway that the player will likely take.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add crabs or make edits to layout to make pathway more
              interesting.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Test path way.</p></li>
          <li><p>Repeat 2-4 until happy with whole level.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Concept and Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          The idea of the game was inspired by the Lybia edmondsoni crab, also
          known as the boxer crab. It is a small crab that has stinging sea
          anemone on its claws. The anemone resembles boxing gloves and it is
          quite humorous when the crab is fighting another fish or crab. The
          unconventional movement was based on the movement of the crab. This
          was a decision that took about a month of prototyping different ideas
          of movement. We were set on the crab-like movement earlier on but it
          took awhile to figure out how we should orientate the camera and make
          the controls as initiative as possible. Typically to move, games use
          arrow or WASD keys to move. Since we wanted the player to move left
          and right more than up and down, we decided to rotate the crab by 90
          degrees. This allowed the players movement input to match the
          direction of the crab while also keeping the crab moving primary
          sideways.
