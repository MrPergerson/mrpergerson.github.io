            Ogres and Goblins, as stepping stones to reach overhangs, or

          will do a ground pound, which does extra damage.<br />Flying Goblins:
          Goblins that fly around and ignore level collisions. You can jump off
          of these as well.<br />Dungeon door: A door that must be found and
          unlocked with a key to escape.<br />Key: Can be collected to unlock
          the door.<br />Gold: Collected from killing enemies.<br />Splint:
          Heals broken bones (health).<br />Armor: Gives the player extra
          protection against enemies.<br />Jump pack: Allows for vertical travel
          at any height. Has limited fuel.

        <h2 class="textbox--title">Level Design</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of the game is to find the dungeon door and key so you can
          escape. Every level is procedurally generated so there will always be
          a different layout. The procedural generation generates a flat ground
          at the bottom where the player will spawn. From there, three pathways
          are created: one that leads to the door, one that leads to the key,
          and one that leads to a dead end. We added one with a dead end so that
          the player is, initially, uncertain about what the pathways lead to.
          This puts the player in an explorer mindset as they jump around the
          level. Since the primary action is jumping, the levels are made up of
          vertical passage ways, but we used some open spaces and horizontal
          passage ways to break up repetition. Sometimes the generation creates
          an area that is impossible to jump so to avoid the player getting
          stuck, ghosts where added as a simple fix. They spawn in open spaces
          as an extra jumping platform.
        </p>
        <h2 class="textbox--title">Enemy Design</h2>
        <p>
          There were still times when the player would get stuck, so the flying
          goblins were introduced as a enemy that could be in any position and
          be jumped off of. The flying goblin can travel through walls and
          floors so it is usually always present. If the player is careful to
          not get hit by the goblin, they can use the goblin as a jumping
          platform. The orc was added as an enemy that would spawn above you and
          fall down. Since the player spends most of the time jumping upwards,
          the player needs to be on guard for orcs.
