            <h1>ABOUT</h1>           
            <p>I am a game designer and digital game developer. Many of my games are about personal experiences and issues that I am passionate about. I draw inspiration from anywhere I can to create my games. As such, traveling, reading, photography, working, and other activities are a core part of my process for designing games. I've published my games on Itch.io and you see my other creative work on my website. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Some of the game projects I worked, I was the producer. I've always been curious about what makes a successful team. In my experience with being a producer, I have learned it takes more than clear communication but confidence to speak and take on commitments. I learned to use SCRUM to help myself organize schedules and for my team to work smarter. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                I'm studying Digital Media Art at SJSU and I'm very active in the game development community on campus. I have held multiple workshops and other events to help others develop their own successful games. I'm currently looking for opportunities to show off my work or get guidance from a mentor or job.   </p>
