                <p>Algae Bandit is a game about being a rogue crab who has chosen to steal food from other crabs. As the player, you get to choose how you want to steal food from crabs, by either using stealth or beating up any crab in the way. This game was developed during the summer of 2020 and was part of the Game Dev Best Practices Workshop, which was hosted by the Game Dev Club at SJSU.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    As the producer I lead a team of two programmers and one artist. My responsibilities included creating and tracking tasks, running sprint evaluations and check-ins, and setting team milestones. We started preproduction in early June and our goal was to finish the game by August, before school started. Using the SCRUM framework as a guide, I ensured that our development process was iterative and communication was flowing.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Within the summer of 2020, we started with a small idea and finished a playable and polished game. We presented our game at the last day of the summer game dev workshop and within that week, we got 70 page visits and 30 plays. Almost a year later, there are over 200 page views and over 100 plays.  </p>
