                    The summer game development workshop is an interdisciplinary group based project that focuses on game development. Teams are formed from the arts and animation, computer science and other disciplines interested in game development. These teams create a prototype over the 8-9 weeks of the workshop within the community of participants. We organizers focus on production, pipeline, design, prototyping, presentation, marketing and player feedback to create the most viable, fun prototype in the limited time. Participants are encouraged to experiment with genre, style, mechanics and any other aspect of game development within the team setting.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    As a workshop lead, I worked with two other San Jose State University professors to plan and lead workshop meetings and assist members. I wrote multiple slide outlines, a game design document outline, and a Trello template. I assisted members by reviewing their design documents, trellos, and game progress. I designed the website and advertisements to get people to sign up.

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Planning for team forming needs to happen far in advance and all data that needs to be taken in needs to happen early, all at once.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Learning how to manage tasks, get time estimates, and managing sprints is just as important as ensuring that members feel that they are contributing to the team.</p>
