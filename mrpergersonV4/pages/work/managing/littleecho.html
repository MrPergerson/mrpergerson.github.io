                    Play as Little Echo, a young bat who lost  their mom in a dark cave. While you can't see far, you can use sound waves to guess where things are. Flap your wings, call out, or listen closely to the environment, and you might just find your way.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I was the producer of a five-person team during global game jam, the largest game making event in the world. I was responsible for note taking, check-ins, and task management for a team of five people. Since we had only 48 hours to finish the game, I keep track of all the decisions we made and pointed contradictions or areas that were not thought out well.  I scheduled check-ins and keep the meetings short and on topic. I ensured everyone was working on a task and was not block.
